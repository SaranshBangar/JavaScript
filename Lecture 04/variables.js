// There are 3 ways to declare a variable and 1 way to declare a constant

const accountId = 10 // "const" keyword prevents the value of the variable from changing throughout the code
let accountEmail = "saranshbangad@gmail.com"
var accountPassword = "1234" // It is not used because of block and functional scope
accountCity = "Gurugram" // Not preffered by programmers
let accountState // It is alloted "undefined" value

console.table([accountId, accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity, accountState]) // Prints all of the variables in a tabular format
